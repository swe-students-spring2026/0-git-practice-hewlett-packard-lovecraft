# We can't send mail farther than 500 miles

The [article](https://web.mit.edu/jemorris/humor/500-miles) I've chosen is one by Terry Harris in 2002 about a bizzare problem he encountered when working University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 

It's interesting because of the great lengths Harris and his coworkers go through to troubleshoot the issue - from collecting data, plotting the failures on a map, consulting a geostatistician, digging through mail server configuration options, and finally calculating the speed of light. It reminds the reader that the interent depends on physical infrastructure rather than some nebulous idea of "cyberspace."

## Comment from Ami

I liked this article because it shows how debugging can involve real-world physics and infrastructure, not just code.
